# Linear Regression and SVM GUI
A GUI application made in python using QT for performing and visualising linear regression and SVM with data in CVS format. More information about the code can be found in the pdf file, currently available only in Croatian language.

**Tldr:** 
The application **doesn't** incorporate preprocessing of data, so the preprocessing has to be done separatly.It only works with **CVS files** (can be easily changed in the code for broader use) and **doesn't** consider data of type object (no date time or strings).
